# Assignment #2

For exercises 1 and 2, you will be using a search algorithm to search for an item in a dataset. You will be testing the efficiency of 2 search algorithms, linear search and binary search. You will also have a UI (a simple textbox will do) through which you will be sending your input that you want to search. There is no server-side to this program. All of this should be done using React.

1. Linear search

Given the following dataset, find out how many tries it took to search for a particular item in the dataset. If the item is not in the dataset, provide a message and indicate how many searches it took to find that out.

89, 30, 25, 32, 72, 70, 51, 42, 25, 24, 53, 55, 78, 50, 13, 40, 48, 32, 26, 2, 14, 33, 45, 72, 56, 44, 21, 88, 27, 68, 15, 62, 93, 98, 73, 28, 16, 46, 87, 28, 65, 38, 67, 16, 85, 63, 23, 69, 64, 91, 9, 70, 81, 27, 97, 82, 6, 88, 3, 7, 46, 13, 11, 64, 76, 31, 26, 38, 28, 13, 17, 69, 90, 1, 6, 7, 64, 43, 9, 73, 80, 98, 46, 27, 22, 87, 49, 83, 6, 39, 42, 51, 54, 84, 34, 53, 78, 40, 14, 5,

2. Binary search

Use the same front end and the dataset from the previous exercise for this exercise. Use array.sort to sort the dataset. Then implement a binary search to find a particular value in the dataset. Display how many tries it took to search for a particular item in the dataset using binary search. If the item is not in the dataset, provide a message and indicate how many searches it took to find that out.
